    <string name="assum_desc_home">Home:  Behavior Tracker guesses your home coordinates on the assumption that most people sleep or are at home on most nights.
    	  A query is made to the point database getting all points recorded between the time 11PM and 5AM.  The most frequently recorded point is assumed to be your home.</string>
    <string name="assum_desc_work">Workplace:  It guesses your work coordinates on the assumption that most people are at work during the day, most days.
    	  A query is made to the point database getting all points recorded between the time 10AM and 4PM.  The most frequently recorded point is assumed to be your workplace.  
    	  This query could be further refined by excluding the dates of all weekends and holidays.</string>
    <string name="assum_desc_holiday">Home or work during Holidays:  The most frequently recorded point on a holiday is the location the user stayed at on the holiday.  
        Using the guessed locations of the home and work, these can be compared to determine if the user was at home, work or elsewhere on that holiday</string>	  
    <string name="assum_desc_points">Collection and Data: The GPS tracker collects a new GPS point every 10 minutes regardless of whether the phone has changed location.  
       If the accuracy of the point is not within 30 meters, the point is discarded.  The data that is collected is the time, date, longitude and latitude.</string>
